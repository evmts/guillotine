## Component Review: Bytecode Analysis and Translation

### Scope (key files)

- `src/evm/analysis.zig`, `src/evm/analysis_cache.zig` — decoding/translation to instruction stream, jump dest validation, per‑pc metadata
- `src/evm/opcodes/memory_size.zig`, `src/evm/opcodes/stack_height_changes.zig` — traits used by analysis
- `src/evm/constants/code_analysis_limits.zig`, `src/evm/constants/instruction_limits.zig`

### What’s working well

- Produces instruction sequences with BEGINBLOCKs containing total gas and stack requirements; aligns with advanced interpreters.
- Computes `pc_to_block_start`, `inst_jump_type`, and jumpdest validity to enable safe and fast control flow at runtime.
- Analysis cache exists to avoid repeated work across identical code (good for repeated calls to the same contract).

### Opportunities

1) Precompute memory and copy shapes
- For memory ops (MLOAD/MSTORE/MSTORE8/MCOPY/CALLDATA*COPY/RETURNDATA*COPY), precompute word counts and aligned sizes when operands are immediate or previously known. Carry as small immediates in `Instruction`.

2) Peephole fusion
- Detect simple sequences inside a block: PUSH1/PUSH1/ALU, DUP/SWAP patterns, MLOAD/MSTORE round‑trips, and emit fused micro‑ops.

3) Static cold/warm hints
- For some ops, the target is statically known (e.g., EXTCODESIZE self). Tag as warm to skip dynamic access cost branches.

4) Cost rollups
- Extend BEGINBLOCK to include a sum of predictable dynamic costs (e.g., memory expansion that is solely based on immediates). Leave genuinely dynamic pieces (e.g., storage) as runtime hooks.

5) Robustness and limits
- Ensure hard limits for max instruction count and block sizes are enforced early with clear errors to prevent pathological decode time on malformed input.

### Bench/observability

- Add analysis‑time counters: blocks formed, pushes fused, memory words precomputed, percent of dynamic gas eliminated at runtime.
- Measure analysis cost vs runtime savings on representative traces (ERC20, DeFi, MCOPY stress) to tune fusion thresholds.

### Actionable checklist

- [ ] Implement memory word/count precompute and attach to instruction variants.
- [ ] Add peephole fusion for common patterns; keep it simple to maintain decode speed.
- [ ] Add analysis stats (debug build) and per‑contract cache hit metrics.

### Comparison to evmone and revm

- evmone (advanced): Heavy decode‑time trait computation and micro‑fusion are central. Adopting the above moves us very close to evmone’s approach.
- revm: Less decode‑time, more reliance on compiler inlining; still benefits from pre‑validated jumpdests. Our analysis path can exceed revm’s runtime overhead if we shift more work off the hot path.
