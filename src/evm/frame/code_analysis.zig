/// Advanced code analysis for EVM bytecode optimization.
///
/// This structure holds pre-computed analysis results for a contract's bytecode,
/// enabling efficient execution by pre-identifying jump destinations, code segments,
/// and other properties that would otherwise need to be computed at runtime.
///
/// The analysis is performed once when a contract is first loaded and cached for
/// subsequent executions, significantly improving performance for frequently-used
/// contracts.
///
/// ## Fields
/// - `code_segments`: Bit vector marking which bytes are executable code vs data
/// - `jumpdest_bitmap`: Bitmap of valid JUMPDEST positions for O(1) validation
/// - `block_gas_costs`: Optional pre-computed gas costs for basic blocks
/// - `max_stack_depth`: Maximum stack depth required by the contract
/// - `has_dynamic_jumps`: Whether the code contains JUMP/JUMPI with dynamic targets
/// - `has_static_jumps`: Whether the code contains JUMP/JUMPI with static targets
/// - `has_selfdestruct`: Whether the code contains SELFDESTRUCT opcode
/// - `has_create`: Whether the code contains CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes
///
/// ## Performance
/// - Jump destination validation: O(1) using bitmap lookup
/// - Code segment checking: O(1) using bit vector
/// - Enables dead code elimination and other optimizations
///
/// ## Memory Management
/// The analysis owns its allocated memory and must be properly cleaned up
/// using the `deinit` method to prevent memory leaks.

/// This is critical for JUMPDEST validation since jump destinations
/// must point to actual code, not data bytes within PUSH instructions.

///
/// This enables O(1) jump destination validation instead of O(log n) binary search.

///
/// Contracts that can deploy other contracts require additional
/// gas reservation and state management considerations.

///
/// Each bit corresponds to a byte position in the bytecode:
/// - 1 = start of a new basic block
/// - 0 = continuation of current block
///
/// Basic blocks are sequences of instructions with single entry/exit points,
/// enabling batch gas and stack validation for performance optimization.
block_starts: BitVec64,

pc_to_block: []u16,

/// Total number of basic blocks identified in the bytecode.

/// This method must be called when the analysis is no longer needed to prevent

/// - `self`: The analysis instance to clean up
/// - `allocator`: The same allocator used to create the analysis resources
///
/// ## Safety
/// After calling deinit, the analysis instance should not be used again.
/// All pointers to analysis data become invalid.

/// ## Example
/// ```zig
/// var analysis = try analyze_code(allocator, bytecode);
