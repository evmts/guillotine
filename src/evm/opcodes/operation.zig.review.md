## Review: opcodes/operation.zig (Operation traits and signatures)

### High-signal findings

- Clear separation of execute function, constant gas, min/max stack, optional dynamic gas and memory size functions; `undefined` marker prevents accidental execution.
- Interpreter/State pointer typedefs simplify handler signatures.

### Opportunities

- Consider shrink‑packing fields (e.g., min/max stack as u16) and reordering for tighter cache footprint, given 256 entries.
- Add an explicit “fusable” flag for analysis to identify operations that can participate in peephole fusion.

### Action items

- [ ] Evaluate field widths and packing to reduce table size.
- [ ] Add optional fusion hint flag used by analysis.

### Comparison to evmone/revm

- Very similar to evmone’s trait descriptors; with packing and hints, we’ll reach equal compactness and decode‑time utility.
