## Review: execution/environment.zig (ADDRESS, BALANCE, ORIGIN, CALLER, CALLVALUE, EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, EXTCODEHASH, SELF balance, CHAINID, CALLDATA*, CODE*, RETURNDATALOAD)

### High-signal findings

- BALANCE/EXT* ops correctly use access list warm/cold accounting via `frame.access_address(...)` and charge returned cost with `consume_gas`, aligning with EIP-2929.
- Copy ops (CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, EXTCODECOPY) compute memory expansion cost via `frame.memory.get_expansion_cost()` and charge dynamic copy gas as `CopyGas * word_count`, using `set_data_bounded` for clamped copies and zero-fill.
- Robust bounds checking on `usize` conversions and `offset + size` arithmetic (using `std.math.add` in other modules and explicit checks here) to prevent overflow/OutOfOffset.
- EXTCODEHASH follows EIP-1052 semantics: non-existent → 0; existent empty code → keccak256("") constant.
- CALLOAD pathways handle short reads by zero-extending to 32 bytes.

### Gaps and TODOs in the code

- ORIGIN, GASPRICE, CHAINID currently push placeholders (0 or 1). These must be wired to real transaction/context fields.
- RETURNDATALOAD is stubbed and always returns 0; needs return data buffer integration.
- Logging for EXTCODECOPY/CODECOPY is present; should be gated out in ReleaseFast to avoid overhead in hot paths.

### Opportunities

- Introduce a small inline helper on `Frame` to charge memory expansion and dynamic copy gas in one place to remove duplication across COPY ops.
- Ensure access list warming of self where applicable (e.g., SELF balance may be warm already depending on call path) for optimal gas on common calls.
- Add tests covering warm vs cold paths for BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODEHASH, and EXTCODECOPY to assert exact gas deltas.
- For CALLDATALOAD/COPY, add tests for offsets near end, zero size, and large sizes, including OutOfOffset behavior.

### Action items

- [ ] Replace ORIGIN/GASPRICE/CHAINID placeholders with real fields on the execution context and plumb values from transaction/chain config.
- [ ] Implement RETURNDATALOAD against the frame/VM return data buffer.
- [ ] Add a `charge_copy_cost(frame, mem_offset, size)` helper to centralize expansion + per-word copy gas.
- [ ] Gate debug logs behind a compile-time flag or `SAFE` to compile out in ReleaseFast.
- [ ] Add warm/cold gas tests and boundary/copy semantics tests for CALLDATA/CODE/EXTCODE variants.

### Correctness notes

- EXTCODE* access ordering is correct: warm/cold charge first, then perform operation.
- `set_data_bounded` enforces safe, clamped copying and zero-padding—matches EVM semantics.
- Empty-size checks early-return, avoiding unnecessary work.

### Comparison to evmone/revm

- Semantics match; primary gaps are placeholder env fields and missing return-data wiring. With those implemented and logs gated, behavior and performance should match evmone and revm.
