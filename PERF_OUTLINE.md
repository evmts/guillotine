#### 6. Issue #332 - Remove intermediate buffers in hash precompiles
- **Complexity**: Medium - Stream data directly
- **Impact**: Low - Reduces allocations
- **Risk**: Low - Localized change
- **Expected Gain**: Less GC pressure

### ðŸ”´ Phase 3: Complex Refactoring

#### 7. Issue #342 - Smart pre-allocation for memory/stack
- **Complexity**: High - Add profiling system
- **Impact**: High - Reduces allocation overhead significantly
- **Risk**: Medium - More complex state management
- **Expected Gain**: 50% reduction in allocation calls

#### 8. Issue #341 - Mandatory extended entries
- **Complexity**: High - Change analysis system
- **Impact**: Medium - Removes conditionals in hot path
- **Risk**: Medium - Affects contract loading
- **Expected Gain**: 1-2% overall improvement

#### 9. Issue #340 - True block-level fast path
- **Complexity**: Very High - Major interpreter refactoring
- **Impact**: Very High - Biggest potential gain
- **Risk**: High - Complex validation logic
- **Expected Gain**: 40%+ on compute-heavy benchmarks

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Issues #338, #339, #335)
   - Quick wins to build momentum
   - Low risk, good gains
   - Learn the codebase

2. **Week 2**: Phase 2 (Issues #334, #333, #332)
   - Moderate complexity builds on Phase 1
   - Good risk/reward ratio
   - Sets up for bigger changes

3. **Week 3-4**: Phase 3 (Issues #342, #341, #340)
   - Tackle in order of increasing complexity
   - #340 has biggest payoff but highest risk
   - May require multiple iterations

## Success Metrics

### Target Performance (vs REVM)
- **snailtracer**: 2.10x â†’ 1.50x (29% improvement)
- **ten-thousand-hashes**: 1.94x â†’ 1.30x (33% improvement)
- **opcodes-push-pop**: 1.39x â†’ 1.10x (21% improvement)
- **erc20-***: 1.06-1.11x â†’ 1.00-1.05x (5% improvement)

## Notes
- Always benchmark after each change
- Create PRs even for failed attempts (marked DO NOT MERGE)
- Stack successful changes, isolate failures
- Focus on relative performance vs REVM, not absolute times
- Small improvements compound - even 1% matters
