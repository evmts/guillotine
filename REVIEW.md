## frame.zig

### 1. Missing Features
- No missing features identified - comprehensive opcode coverage

### 2. Bugs
- Duplicate implementation: Both `keccak256` (line 717) and `op_keccak256` (line 790) exist

### 3. TODO/Unfinished Code
- Line 3415-3420: SELFDESTRUCT tests commented out - "needs update for current frame structure"
- Line 4499: JUMP/JUMPI tests removed - noted as "handled by the Plan layer"

### 4. Unnecessary Branching
- None found - branching appears necessary

### 5. Unclean Code
- **Major inconsistency**: Mixed naming conventions for opcodes:
  - Direct names: `add`, `mul`, `sub`, `div`, `pop`, `mload`, `mstore`, `sload`, `sstore`
  - Prefixed names: `op_address`, `op_balance`, `op_calldataload`, `op_call`, `op_delegatecall`
  - Duplicate functions: Both `keccak256` and `op_keccak256` exist
- Temporary constants defined (lines 40-51) - should be moved to primitives module

### 6. Complex Features Without Documentation
- Gas manager integration well documented
- Tracer integration clearly explained

### 7. Missing Test Coverage
- SELFDESTRUCT tests are commented out
- No tests for error conditions in database operations
- Limited tests for gas overflow scenarios

### 8. Oversized Data Types
- All data types appear appropriately sized

### 9. Data-Oriented Design Issues
- Good: Hot data (stack, bytecode, gas_manager) in first cache line
- Good: Tracer is conditional compilation (zero cost when disabled)
- Issue: `logs` ArrayList could fragment memory during execution

### 10. Branch Prediction
- Good use of inline functions for tracer calls
- Could benefit from `@branchHint` for common success paths

### 11. Performance Issues
- Log allocation per operation could use arena allocator
- Multiple database lookups for same address in some operations

### 12. Code for Abstraction
- Memory expansion cost calculation repeated in multiple opcodes
- Stack bounds checking pattern repeated (though this might be intentional for performance)

### 13. Other Suggestions
- Consider standardizing all opcode function names (remove `op_` prefix entirely)
- The `GasManager` abstraction seems like it could be simplified - gas tracking could be inline
- Consider using a single allocation for all log data in a frame

## evm.zig

### 1. Missing Features
- Block hash storage not implemented (line 1302: returns null)
- Blob support not implemented for EIP-4844 (lines 1310, 1318: returns null/0)
- Chain rules integration for precompiles pending (line 907)
- Advanced planner strategy blocked by incomplete plan_minimal module (lines 46-50)

### 2. Bugs
- Memory leak in `takeLogs` function (lines 1111-1115): Topics and data are not freed when logs are moved
- Inconsistent error handling in database operations - some return CallResult.failure(0), others propagate errors

### 3. TODO/Unfinished Code
- Lines 729-1422: Old `call_old` implementation marked "to be removed"
- Line 1208: Simplified account restoration noted as incomplete
- Line 1578: Test commented out with "not implemented"
- Multiple tests commented out (lines 1585-1587, 1656, 1728)

### 4. Unnecessary Branching
- None found - branching appears necessary for EVM semantics

### 5. Unclean Code
- Duplicate code between call handlers (call_regular, callcode_handler, delegatecall_handler, staticcall_handler) - balance checks and snapshot creation repeated
- Mixed naming conventions: `call_regular` vs `callcode_handler`
- Hardcoded account structure (lines 316-321) should use a default/empty constant

### 6. Complex Features Without Documentation
- None found - code is well documented

### 7. Missing Test Coverage
- Several tests are incomplete or commented out
- No tests for blob-related functions
- Limited test coverage for error conditions in nested calls

### 8. Oversized Data Types
- `gas_price` stored as u256 but could potentially be smaller
- `DepthType` correctly sized based on max_call_depth

### 9. Data-Oriented Design Issues
- Good: Hot data (depth, static_stack) grouped together
- Issue: `logs` ArrayList could cause allocation fragmentation during execution
- Issue: Multiple small allocations for log topics/data instead of arena allocation

### 10. Branch Prediction
- Good use of early returns for error conditions
- No branch hints used where they could help (e.g., depth check likely to pass)

### 11. Performance Issues
- Repeated account lookups in value transfer code (lines 258, 295, 311)
- Log allocation/deallocation per call could use arena allocator
- No caching of account data within a call

### 12. Code for Abstraction
- Value transfer logic repeated across multiple functions - should be extracted
- Snapshot creation/reversion pattern repeated - could be abstracted with defer pattern
- Precompile checking logic duplicated

### 13. Other Suggestions
- Consider using an arena allocator for temporary allocations within a transaction
- The `current_snapshot_id` field seems redundant with journal's internal tracking
- Error types could be more specific (e.g., DatabaseError vs generic Error)
- Consider separating EVM orchestration from state management concerns
