## Review: bench/official/src/main.zig (CLI orchestrator)

### High-signal findings

- Flexible CLI supporting compare mode across Zig/REVM/EthereumJS/Geth/evmone; exports Markdown summaries. Good structure for reproducible perf comparisons.

### Opportunities

- Ensure ReleaseFast builds for Zig and appropriate flags for others are documented/enforced. Consider adding CSV export.
