  Environment variable ETHASH_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/Download/Hunter/0.24.5/d7279c1/Unpacked/cmake/modules/hunter_lock_directory.cmake:4 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

-- [hunter] INTX_ROOT: /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install (ver.: 0.8.0)
CMake Warning (dev) at build/_deps/evmone-src/lib/evmone/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable INTX_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  Environment variable INTX_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
