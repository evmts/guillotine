CMake Warning (dev) at build/_deps/evmone-src/CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable ETHASH_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  Environment variable ETHASH_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at build/_deps/evmone-src/lib/evmone/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable INTX_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  Environment variable INTX_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/williamcory/.hunter/_Base/d7279c1/093c2f0/7ad575f/Install

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
