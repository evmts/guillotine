## Component Review: Interpreter Core (Instruction Stream Execution)

### Scope (key files)

- `src/evm/evm/interpret.zig` — basic‑block interpreter over translated instruction stream
- `src/evm/instruction.zig` — instruction struct, `BlockInfo`, dynamic gas descriptor
- `src/evm/jump_table/jump_table.zig`, `inline_hot_ops.zig` — execute funcs and hot‑op inlining

### What’s working well

- BEGINBLOCK upfront validation (gas, min stack, max growth) reduces per‑op checks and improves predictability.
- Dynamic JUMP/JUMPI validated with precomputed `pc_to_block_start` and `valid_jumpdest` data; clean index arithmetic.
- Inline fast paths for the hottest opcodes eliminate function pointer indirection.
- Clear separation between `.none`, `.gas_cost`, and `.dynamic_gas` instruction variants keeps the loop simple.

### Opportunities

1) Decode‑time enrichment
- Embed per‑op precomputed small integers: e.g., memory words, copy lengths, or pre‑aligned sizes. This removes divisions and multiple casts inside the loop.

2) Instruction and metadata locality
- Ensure `instructions` and associated tables (`pc_to_block_start`, `inst_jump_type`) are allocated from the same slab to improve D‑cache locality.

3) Loop variable hoisting
- Cache `instructions.ptr` and frequently used analysis fields in local consts to help the compiler (Zig often does this, but explicit local aliases can help in tight loops).

4) MAX_ITERATIONS guard
- Good for debug; consider switching to a block counter (BEGINBLOCKs executed) which correlates better with progress than raw loop iterations on code with many no‑ops.

5) Error fast‑paths
- INVALID/OutOfGas are frequent terminal states; keep return branches as short as possible and ensure unlikely annotations are accurate under real traces.

### Micro‑opt ideas

- Convert `current_index` arithmetic for jumps into a small helper that inlines into two instructions (ptr‑diff + bounds check); currently it’s clear but repeated.
- For `.push_value`, batching multiple consecutive PUSHes into a fused instruction during analysis would reduce loop overhead in PUSH‑heavy sequences.

### Bench/observability

- Add a microbench sweeping synthetic mixes (PUSH‑heavy, ALU‑heavy, MEM‑heavy, CALL‑heavy) and export cycles/op and branch‑miss/op. Track post‑decode work per instruction.
- Allow a compile‑time “trace” to dump 1 in N blocks executed to a ring buffer (no logging in hot loop at release).

### Actionable checklist

- [ ] Enrich instructions with precomputed memory word counts and small immediates.
- [ ] Co‑allocate instruction array and per‑pc metadata.
- [ ] Add fused PUSH sequence emission in analysis.

### Comparison to evmone and revm

- evmone (advanced): Very similar basic‑block interpreter; more decode‑time computed traits and some micro‑fusion. With the enrichments above, our loop should be on parity.
- revm: Relies on optimized Rust dispatch and inlining; not an instruction stream, but performance characteristics are similar when branches are predictable. Our approach is competitive when decode‑time work is maximized.
