**The ultrafast EVM for every language and platform**

---

## 🚧 Development Status (Early Alpha)

**Current Status**: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

Guillotine is not suitable for production use at this time. Any use of Guillotine should be considered purely experimental.

### 📊 Ethereum Specification Test Results

**Latest Test Run**: 159 tests executed
- ✅ **35 passing** (22.0% pass rate)
- ❌ **124 failing** (78.0% fail rate)

**Failure Categories**:
- `AccountNotFound` errors: ~30% of failures (account state management issues in Zig EVM)
- `EVM execution failed`: ~25% of failures (gas/execution issues in Zig EVM)
- Assembly syntax tests: ~20% of failures (Python test infrastructure limitation - not yet implemented)
- Invalid hex data: ~15% of failures (Python SDK spec compatibility issue)
- File parsing errors: ~10% of failures (Python test infrastructure - YAML format not yet supported)

Note: Some failures are due to the Python SDK and test infrastructure not being fully spec-compliant yet, rather than issues in the core Zig EVM implementation.

**Current Development Focus**: Our primary goal is achieving 100% Ethereum specification compliance while ensuring complete safety, debuggability, and observability through our tracer system ([`src/tracer/tracer.zig`](src/tracer/tracer.zig)). The tracer provides comprehensive execution monitoring, differential testing against a reference implementation, and detailed error reporting for every opcode.

See [test report](specs/test_report.md) for detailed results. For an in-depth understanding of Guillotine's design and implementation, see our comprehensive [Architecture Documentation](docs/pages/architecture.mdx). Follow the [issue tracker](https://github.com/evmts/Guillotine/issues) for features planned for Beta.

**Network Support**: Currently only **Ethereum Mainnet** is supported. Planned for Beta:

- **OP Stack** support (Optimism, Base, etc.)
- **Arbitrum Nitro** support

## 📊 Benchmarks & Bundle Size 🚧

Guillotine is fast.

Benchmarks so far look very promising.

- Guillotine shows measurable performance gains over [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) and performance on par with [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone).
- More major optimizations planned for Beta release

### Overall Performance Summary (Per Run)

These benchmarks were taken using the [evm-bench](https://github.com/ziyadedher/evm-bench) test cases with `hyperfine`.

- Benchmarking infra can be seen in previous commits but is currently being moved to its [own dedicated repo](https://github.com/evmts/evm-benchmarks).
- Looking for contributors to help set up easily reproducible benchmarks

- **MinimalEvm**: Minimal implementation focused on tracing (57,641 bytes)
- **Guillotine EVM**: Core EVM implementation
- **Primitives**: Complete primitives library
- **Full Package**: All features including precompiles

Note: Smaller packages use `ReleaseSmall` optimization for size, while the full package uses `ReleaseFast` for performance.
**ReleaseSafe** builds (recommended for alpha) are larger due to additional safety features and validation overhead.

### How is Guillotine so fast?

Guillotine was built using [data-oriented design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) with an emphasis on [minimizing branch-prediction misses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nczJ58WvtYo) in the CPU. We studied every EVM implementation as well as [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter implementations for the state of the art. Optimizations include, from most impactful to least impactful:

- An extremely optimized StackFrame and opcode dispatch data structure
- [Indirect threading via tailcall recursion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43317592) (for excellent CPU branch prediction)
- Highly microoptimized opcode instruction handlers
- Highly microoptimized EVM stack implementation
- Opcode fusions turning common opcode patterns into a single dispatch
- **Assembly-optimized Keccak** via [keccak-asm](https://crates.io/crates/keccak-asm)
- Batching calculation of static gas costs and stack analysis
- Simple code that minimizes unnecessary abstractions, inline directives, and interfaces allowing the Zig compiler maximum freedom to optimize for performance or size
- Additional micro-optimizations not listed

**Balanced tradeoffs**

We focus on maintainable code and targeted optimizations where they matter. We do our best to write simple code the Zig compiler can optimize.

There are many more optimizations that have not been implemented yet. The biggest of which will be translating our stack-based EVM into a register-based EVM—a common technique used by interpreters like Lua and PyPy, and Cranelift-style designs—to achieve up to ~30% performance increases.

---

### How is Guillotine so small?

- Zig avoids hidden control flow.
- This makes it really easy to write the most minimal simple code needed to get the job done.
- By minimizing unnecessary abstractions the compiler is able to do a great job optimizing for size.
- Zig `comptime` allows us to easily and surgically only include the minimum necessary code given the specific EVM and hard fork configuration. Code you don't use isn't included.

### How is Guillotine so safe?

Guillotine is in early alpha, but we prioritize safety through multiple build modes and extensive testing:

#### Build Modes

- **Debug**: Full debugging symbols and runtime checks
- **ReleaseFast**: Optimized for maximum performance
- **ReleaseSmall**: Optimized for minimal bundle size
- **ReleaseSafe** (⭐ **RECOMMENDED FOR ALPHA**): Our most defensive build mode

#### ReleaseSafe Features

**ReleaseSafe** includes a comprehensive safety system that runs a simplified EVM as a sidecar to validate execution:

- ✅ **Parallel Validation**: Runs a minimal EVM implementation alongside to cross-check results
- ✅ **Safety Checks**: Validates execution at every step to ensure correctness
- ✅ **Infinite Loop Protection**: Prevents runaway execution with instruction limits
- ✅ **Advanced Tracing**: Full event system for monitoring EVM execution
- ✅ **Debugging Support**: Can run as a debugger with step-by-step execution
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Preserves all debug-mode defensive checks
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of all EVM operations

While ReleaseSafe has performance overhead compared to ReleaseFast, it provides critical safety guarantees during alpha development.

#### Additional Safety Measures

- Extensive unit, E2E, fuzz, benchmark, and differential test suites
- Continuous validation against reference implementations
- Memory safety checks and bounds validation

## 🚧 Full Client

Guillotine is a VM implementation (like [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm)) not a full node (like [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)).
However, [Tevm](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo) (the team behind Guillotine) plans to begin work on a highly performant Zig-based full client soon. This client will leverage parts of Guillotine's architecture to execute transactions in parallel and architect around I/O bottlenecks.

---

## Additional features

### Zero Config

Guillotine ships with opinionated defaults and is mainnet‑ready with zero configuration.

---

### Customizability

Guillotine is built from the ground up to be a highly customizable EVM SDK.

**With Guillotine you can easily create your own EVM!**

Using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `comptime`, you configure features with regular Zig code, and the compiler includes only what you use. [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) offers similar customizability but requires more onboarding into complex generics and feature flags compared to Zig `comptime`.

Customizability features include

- Configure any hard fork or EIP
- Add or override opcodes and precompiles in the EVM
- Simple, powerful tracer interface for introspection
- Comprehensive options to configure the EVM (including niche settings like changing the word size from `u256`)
- `comptime` validation to ensure configurations are sound

All customizations are zero‑cost, compile‑time abstractions using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `comptime`, so customizations never sacrifice runtime performance and your bundle includes only the features you choose to use.

For most users who don't need customizations, we offer default options for all major hard forks.

🚧 This feature is considered experimental and the API could change.

## 🔁 Relationship to Tevm

Once stable, **Guillotine’s Wasm build** will replace the current JavaScript EVM in [Tevm](https://node.tevm.sh).
Upgrades include:

- 🚀 **Up to 1000x performance boost**
- 📉 **300 KB (75%) bundle size reduction**
- 🧱 **Fast Ethereum library** An ultrafast utility and client library wrapping the Guillotine primitives package
