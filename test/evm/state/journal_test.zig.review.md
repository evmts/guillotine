## Review: test/evm/state/journal_test.zig

### Coverage assessment

- Validates journal entry creation and revert behavior; good unit focus.

### Opportunities

- Add cases for large numbers of entries, nested snapshots, revert of mixed entry types (storage, nonce, balance, code, logs).
- When SSTORE refunds are added, test refund unwind on revert.

### Action items

- [ ] Add nested/mixed revert stress cases and refund unwind tests.
