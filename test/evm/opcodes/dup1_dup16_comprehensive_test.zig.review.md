## Review: test/evm/opcodes/dup1_dup16_comprehensive_test.zig

### Coverage assessment

- Exercises full DUP range with stack depth checks. Good.

### Opportunities

- Add performance‑oriented micro case (non‑benchmark) that repeatedly executes DUP patterns to catch regressions in inlining/stack helpers.

### Action items

- [ ] Add a tight DUP loop test (with a small iteration count) to catch accidental slow paths.
